        <p><b>Homer Jay Simpson</b> (born May 12, 1951) is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is
            the
            spouse
            of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds),
            lazy,
            and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great
            caring,
            love,
            and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main
            protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie. He is 39 years old and was born in 1951. </p>

        <p><b>Lisa Marie Simpson</b> (born May 9) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one
            of
            the
            two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who
            exceeds
            the
            standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also
            the
            moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which
            leads
            to
            hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced
            studies. In
            school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with
            only
            a
            few friends.</p>
